Open tools for Figma files.

Parse, inspect, render, and modify `.deck` and `.fig` files without the Figma application.

## Install

```bash
npm install -g openfig-cli
```

Node 18+. No build step. Pure ESM.

## Convert from Claude Design

OpenFig converts standalone HTML exports from
[claude.ai/design](https://claude.ai/design) into editable Figma Slides
decks — text, images, vectors, layouts, and speaker notes carry through
as native nodes. Not a flat raster.

### 1. Create a Slide Deck project

In Claude Design, choose the **Slide deck** tab and create your project.
The **Use speaker notes** toggle is optional; if on, OpenFig maps notes
to each slide.

### 2. Build your deck, then export

When you're done designing, click **Share → Export as standalone HTML**.

<img src="docs/images/export_standalone_html.png" alt="Export as standalone HTML" width="720" />

Claude Design generates a single self-contained file named
`{Project Name} (Standalone).html` — all slides, images, fonts, and the
rendering engine inlined. Works offline.

### 3. Convert to .deck

```bash
openfig convert-html "London Underground Map (Standalone).html" -o lu.deck
open lu.deck   # opens directly in Figma Slides
```

## File Format Support

| Product | Extension | Read | Render | Modify |
|---------|-----------|------|--------|--------|
| Figma Slides | `.deck` | ✅ | ✅ PNG / PDF | ✅ |
| Figma Design | `.fig` | ✅ | ✅ PNG / PDF | ✅ |

## CLI

```bash
# Read & inspect (works on .deck and .fig)
openfig inspect deck.deck              # node hierarchy tree
openfig list-text deck.deck            # all text and image content per slide
openfig list-overrides deck.deck       # editable override keys per symbol

# Render (works on .deck and .fig)
openfig export deck.deck               # export slides/frames as PNG
openfig pdf deck.deck                  # export as multi-page PDF

# Create (.deck only)
openfig create-deck -o new.deck [--title "Name"] [--layout cover --layout content ...]

# Modify (.deck only)
openfig update-text deck.deck -o out.deck --slide <id> --set "key=value"
openfig insert-image deck.deck -o out.deck --slide <id> --key <nodeId> --image <path>
openfig clone-slide deck.deck -o out.deck --template <id|name> --name <name> [--set key=value ...]
openfig remove-slide deck.deck -o out.deck --slide <id>
openfig roundtrip in.deck out.deck     # decode + re-encode validation
```

## Why native `.deck`?

Figma Slides lets you download and re-upload `.deck` files losslessly. Exporting to `.pptx` is lossy — vectors rasterize, fonts fall back, layout breaks. OpenFig makes this native round-trip programmable: download, modify, re-upload.

Plug in Claude Cowork or any coding agent and you have an AI that can read and edit Figma presentations end-to-end — without opening the Figma UI.

### Native browser image derivatives

`openfig browser-images SPEC.json --out DIRECTORY` compacts embedded image leaves of already-native SVG artwork. The source-bound specification contains `sourceFacts`, `sourceSha256`, `maxDimension`, `states` (`nodeId`, `svg`, `svgSha256`) and `adjustments` (`nodeId`, `paintIndex`, `imageHash`, exact `paintFilter`, `fileKey`, `pdf`, `pdfSha256`). Original image bytes must match the source SHA-1; geometry, masks, transforms and intrinsic SVG dimensions remain unchanged. Nonzero adjustments require an exact-leaf official PDF image stream with matching intrinsic dimensions. This uses the source engine rather than approximating its sliders with CSS filters. SVG exports alone omit native image adjustments. The output report retains source values and immutable derivative hashes. Keep original source inputs and exports private; only the permitted compact runtime derivatives belong in a published component. Animated images, ambiguous repeated paints and unsupported PDF encodings fail closed.
